# antihebbhopfield
Python codes for results in Tatsuya Haga, Tomoki Fukai, "Extended temporal association memory by modulations of inhibitory circuits".
Codes are written in Python3 with numpy, scipy, matplotlib,seaborn libraries. Commands are written in shell scripts ("batch.sh").
Massive parallel computations are performed in Fig2 and Fig3_montecarlo_external_eval. To limit the number of processes, change the variable "Nprocess".
